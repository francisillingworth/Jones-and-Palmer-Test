# Jones an Palmer Test

This simple web application was built to replicate a the challenge example as best possible. This has been done almost to the pixel with a few added extras thrown in such as a card carosel, an error page, and multiple other interactive elements


## Demo

A live Demo of the app can be found [here](https://francisillingworth.github.io/Jones-and-Palmer-Test/)

## UX

This website has been designed to replicate the example identically. I created it in a mobile first manner meaning that the project is responsive and will change depending on window size.

I made the application as interactive as possible with the material provided by adding an error page that redirects you back to index.html should you click an external link. I added a text carousel in section 3 
with 3 cards as I felt the the example provided suggested that thats what would be there in the real website.

All interactive elements on the page will have some resopnse when interacted with (links, navigation buttons on carousel etc).
